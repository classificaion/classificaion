sorry
Very happy with my training. The truth is from a period of at least 10 years or more. I found in the sidelines of Internet browsers a lot of services that used to exhaust us and take our effort and time, for example (documentation), which has been part of my project for 14 years. We practice classifying and authenticating client documents from the project owner to the mayor. The most important thing is that the applicable classification standards do not work at the present time, and they no longer have outputs that the client is committed to, just as I worked in the press, starting with Al-Watan newspaper, for a year. He moved to Al Jazeera newspaper as Director of the Economic Department for 6 years. I spent 5 years as a part time writer. The beginning of the professional stage by assigning the economic channel as a programmer, and the opening of our office as a rating company in mid-2009, and we continue to interact more by opening the way for the younger generation. This got us into a state of brainstorming. I graduated in Economics in 2001... I have worked in TV and Journalism since I was a freshman and completed 11 years there. CEO and founder of the Economic Development Company for 10 years, founder of a rating company for 14 years - member of the Economists Association for 10 years - member of the Accountants Association for 7 years - member of the Evaluators Authority for 7 years. Resident expert and licensed administrative, financial and economic advisor. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to say in my name, the work team, and the Etimad Tasneef Company that we cannot be the cause of anything that delays our project or any project that benefits the country and the nation. citizen. And the world to obtain quality and sustainability at work, health and safety, what we need is your directives and your implementation from us. And accept my regards
